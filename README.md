# Red Hat OpenShift 4 on IBM Cloud - Bring it all together

In this hands-on lab you will learn how to use the OpenShift 4 Container Platform on IBM Cloud. The goal of OpenShift is to provide a great experience for both Developers and System Administrators to develop, deploy, and run containerized applications.

You will familiarize yourself with OpenShift 4, deploy a micro-service Node.js application to OpenShift, scale the application, connect to a Cloudant DBaaS, check logs with LogDNA and monitor with Sysdig.
